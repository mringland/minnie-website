Hi! Thanks so much for visiting my page.

I'm currently pursuing a master's degree from the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management at UCSB, with a focus on Economics and Politics of the Environment, as well as Energy and Climate. I have a background in biology, experience in industrial environmental compliance, and am now focused on finding ways to promote a low-carbon future through policy and corporate standards.

I am a transplant from Buffalo, NY and am now flourishing in sunny Santa Barbara, CA. When I'm not in classes or meetings, I like to go for walks on the beach, tend to our backyard compost, and dream of places to go once we can travel again.
