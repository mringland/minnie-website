Thanks so much for visiting my page.\r\n            I’m currently pursuing a master’s degree from the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management at UCSB, with a focus on Economics and Politics of the Environment, as well as Energy and Climate. I have a background in biology, experience in industrial environmental compliance, and am now focused on finding ways to promote a low-carbon future through policy and corporate standards.\r\n            I am a transplant from Buffalo, NY and am now flourishing in sunny Santa Barbara, CA. When I’m not in classes or meetings, I like to go for walks on the beach, tend to our backyard compost, and dream of places to go once we can travel again.\r\n            \r\n          \r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n      \r\n        \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n            \r\n              Minnie Ringland\r\n            \r\n            \r\n              \r\n                \r\n                                    \r\n                    \r\n                      LinkedIn\r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                                    \r\n                    \r\n                      GitHub\r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                                    \r\n                    \r\n                      Email\r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                                  \r\n              \r\n            \r\n            \r\n              Hi!
